        "abstract": "Fuzzy systems based on the interval type-2 fuzzy set have many advantages in processing uncertain data compared with the fuzzy systems based on the type-1 fuzzy set. The design of optimal interval type-2 fuzzy systems is often difficult due to many parameters. The selection and construction of membership functions used to map the crisp inputs to fuzzifier data play an important role and greatly influence the accuracy of the fuzzy system. The paper proposes a hybrid optimization model using swarm optimization algorithms to find the parameters for the membership function of the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS). For the experiment, the paper uses optimization techniques such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO) to find the optimal parameter for IT2FLS applied to the classification problem. Experimental results on datasets from the UCI machine learning library and satellite image data show that hybrid optimization models between the optimization algorithm and IT2FLS can help IT2FLS achieve higher accuracy in data classification problems.",

        "abstract": "Through the advancement of science and technology, every day new methods or computational techniques are emerging that allow to solve problems in widely different areas, such as medicine, engineering, even in any industrial process. Optimization is of vital importance in applications and in industry, the main objective being to find the best possible solution to a particular problem of interest. In this work we propose to use the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), which is a relatively new meta-heuristic, inspired by the hunting behavior and leadership hierarchy of grey wolves, for the optimization of fuzzy controllers for mobile autonomous robots. In addition to analyzing and explaining the proposed methodology based on GWO we are presenting simulation results for a two wheeled autonomous mobile robot to validate the efficiency of the proposed approach. ,",

The implementation of this type-2 FLS involves the operations of fuzzification, inference, and output processing. We focus on \"output processing,\" which consists of type reduction and defuzzification. Type-reduction methods are extended versions of type-1 defuzzification methods. Type reduction captures more information about rule uncertainties than does the defuzzified value (a crisp number), however, it is computationally intensive, except for interval type-2 fuzzy sets for which we provide a simple type-reduction computation procedure. We also apply a type-2 FLS to time-varying channel equalization and demonstrate that it provides better performance than a type-1 FLS and nearest neighbor classifier.",

        "abstract": "A neuro-fuzzy system is a learning machine that finds the parameters of a fuzzy system using approximate techniques of neural networks. Both neural network and fuzzy system have common features. These can solve problems that have no mathematical models. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is an adaptive network that uses supervised learning on learning algorithm. To achieve effective results with ANFIS, selecting the optimization method in training is very important. Heuristics and metaheuristics algorithms attempt to find the best solution out of all possible solutions to an optimization problem. ANFIS training can be based on nonderivative algorithms. Heuristics and metaheuristics are nonderivative algorithms that can lead to better performance in ANFIS training. Most heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms are taken from the behavior of biological systems or physical systems in nature. The newly released emperor penguins colony (EPC) algorithm is a population-based and nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm. This algorithm has much potential for solving various problems. In this article, an optimized ANFIS based on the new EPC algorithm is proposed. The optimized ANFIS is compared with other nonderivative algorithms on benchmark data sets. Eventually, the proposed algorithm is used to solve the classical inverted pendulum problem. The results show that the proposed ANFIS based on the EPC algorithm has less error and better performance than other state-of-the-art algorithms in both training and testing phase. ,",

        "abstract": "Multiple effect evaporator used in sugar industry has the biggest and most complex evaporation process which may be met in an industry. The economy of sugar manufacturing depends strongly on the multiple effect evaporator. It is therefore of interest to optimize this process in order to decrease energy consumption as well as to enhance the quality of sugar. Such an optimization can be achieved by applying efficient techniques like the Taguchi Method. This paper discusses the modeling and optimization of a quadruple effect evaporator used in sugar industries. Modeling has been performed in MATLAB and a Simulink file has been prepared with the data collected from Bhogawati Sugar Industry, Kolhapur, MS, India. For optimization of the evaporation process, Taguchi technique integrated with Fuzzy logic has been employed. A Multi Response Performance Index (MRPI) has been calculated for optimization. The evaporation parameters viz. Feed temperature, Feed flow rate and Steam flow rate have been optimized with consideration of multiple performance characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Timely and accurate identification and classification of victims in earthquakes is crucial for improving rescue efficiency, but available information about victims and their surrounding environment is often vague and imprecise. Rescue wings is a web-based intelligent system that monitors and analyzes the statuses of identified victims to support decision making in earthquake rescue operations. A key component of the system is a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S)-type neuro-fuzzy network for disaster-stricken population classification, and one important input of the network is the output of another T-S-type recurrent neuro-fuzzy network for recognizing the movement patterns from the users' temporal location data. A novel differential biogeography-based optimization (DBBO) algorithm is developed for parameter optimization of both the main network and the subnetwork. Experimental results have shown that the hybrid neuro-fuzzy network exhibits good classification performance in comparison with some other typical neuro-fuzzy networks, and the proposed DBBO outperforms some state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in network learning. The solution approach has also been successfully applied to the 2013 Ya'an Earthquake in Sichuan province, China. ,",
